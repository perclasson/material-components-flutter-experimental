## The Examples
In alphabetical order...

* **Automata** by [Nick Fox-Gieg](https://github.com/n1ckfg) - A simple cellular-automota experiment.

* **Ballpit** by [Kyle Phillips](https://github.com/hapticdata) - A 2d ballpit mural with physics simulation.
	
* **Blocksquish** by [Jeremy Abel](https://github.com/jeremyabel) - The Google logo redrawn as giant squishy rectangles. Touch a letter and it will spring to life.

* **Bouncetype** by [Jeremy Abel](https://github.com/jeremyabel) - Each letter in this bouncy Google logo grow and shrink on 
touch.

* **Heatmap** by [Jeremy Abel](https://github.com/jeremyabel) - An interactive fluid and convention simulation. Touch a button to increase the temperature and watch the fluid curl around the Google logo.

* **Hyperspace** by [Jeremy Abel](https://github.com/jeremyabel) - A leisurely flight through the cosmos. Tap to generate a 
shower of stars or hold to jump to hyperspeed.

* **Inconvergent** by [Anders Hoff](https://github.com/inconvergent) - Randomly spawning particles interact with a colorful wave-like particle spawn generated on touch.

* **Iridescent Life** by [Felix Woitzel](https://github.com/flexi23) - A Bezier spline script drawing animation that writes a scripted Google mixed with an implementation of Conway’s Game of Life and a fluid simulation in WebGL shader code.

* **Reaction** by [Jeremy Abel](https://github.com/jeremyabel) - A simulation of two virtual chemicals interacting according to the rules of a Reaction-Diffusion system.

* **Rope** by [Jeremy Abel](https://github.com/jeremyabel) - A colorful rope traces an undulating hand-drawn “Google” script 
across the screen. Touch and the rope forms a loop around your finger.

* **Squishy** by [Jeramy Morrill](https://github.com/theceremony) - A liquid simulation creates gelatinous, squishy letters that can be thrown around the board. Built using Box2D and Liquidfun.
